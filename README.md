## Developer instructions

**NOTE**: 
* To run this project, you **MUST** install Flutter SDK on your machine. Refer to [Flutter's documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and follow a step-by-step guide on how you can install Flutter SDK on your OS.

* Make sure you have installed Android Studio or a text editor of your choice - VS Code or XCode.
